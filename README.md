## 🔁 What's New

This version of the roulette game has been entirely restructured with:

- ✅ Clean modular C code (`src/`, `include/`)
- ✅ `Makefile` build system
- ✅ Simple login system with file persistence
- ✅ Profile balance tracking (saved inside `data/`)
- ✅ Improved input validation and terminal UX

Currently supported bets:
- 🎯 Specific number (0–36)
- ⚫ EVEN / 🔴 ODD
- 📉 LESS than 18 / 📈 GREATER than 18

> ✨ Colors and new features are planned in upcoming releases

## 🚀 Usage

### ▶️ Compile & Run (macOS / Linux / WSL):

```bash
make
./roulette
```
or if you use the bin folder:

```bash
./bin/roulette
```
📝 When prompted, type your username — it will create a file in data/ to track your balance.
